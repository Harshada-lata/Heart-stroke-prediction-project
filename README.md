Heart stroke prediction is a critical issue, as it remains one of the leading causes of death globally. Predicting an individual's likelihood of experiencing a heart stroke can help healthcare providers take proactive measures to prevent the occurrence of a stroke. 

To effectively predict heart strokes, various factors such as age, gender, medical history, lifestyle habits, and genetic predispositions need to be considered. Developing accurate prediction models can aid in early detection and timely intervention, ultimately reducing the burden of heart strokes on individuals and healthcare systems.
                 
Solution: Develop a machine learning model like Logistic Regression,Random Forest,Decision Tree that analyzes key factors such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking habits, and family history to predict the probability of a person having a heart stroke. The model can be trained on a dataset of past cases of heart strokes to accurately predict the risk for future individuals. This predictive model can help healthcare professionals identify high-risk individuals and provide them with timely interventions to prevent heart strokes.
